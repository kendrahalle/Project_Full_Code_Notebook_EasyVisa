## This project involves developing machine learning models to predict visa approval outcomes for the OFLC. By analyzing applicant data and identifying key influencing factors, we aim to streamline the visa approval process, optimize resource allocation, and improve decision-making accuracy. The ML models will provide valuable insights into applicant profiles, enabling OFLC to prioritize cases and make informed recommendations for visa certification or denial.
